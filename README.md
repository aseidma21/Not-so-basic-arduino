## Hello Functions

What it does:Uses functions to move a servo via ultrasonic sensor.

Struggles: It was my first time coding with an ultrasonic sensor, so I did really understand how to. Also it was hard to understand the functions at first

What I learned: I learned to remember to use the line Serial.println so that I know what's happening or why it's not working

## New Ping

What it does: Blinked an LED based on distance from the ultrasonic sensor

Struggles: This one wasn't too hard because I was mostly using my hello functions code and the code the someone had already written. It was mostly only difficult to try and understand what he had written, so that I understood what I was doing instead of just blindly trying to code it. 

What I learned: It's okay to use code from other people and modify it to your use
